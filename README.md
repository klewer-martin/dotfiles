# Config files from my arch+i3 build

This folder contains all my config files from my personal computer.

The OS is Arch linux and the window manager is I3-gaps, I don't use
a login manager, so i have in my zsh a dedicated part to startx on login.

I have auto login on tty1 so I dont have to put my user and passwd everytime I start
the computer.

Also to not login completly without any password I configured i3 lock to start after
startx is executed.
